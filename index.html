      <h2>Essay on Cheating</h2>
      <p>Correlation does not always show causation. Because of the
     numerous different variables that actually result in a grade,
   because grades are correlated does not indicate that they are directly
 related to each other in terms of direct assistance to each other. This
can relate to how much time they each spent on the homework, or how well they
listen in class as well. Two students may be doing similarly but both poorly,
so logically why would they cheat off each other when they both do not understand the
material and coincidentally have a high correlation of grades. Students can also
be highly negatively correlated, which migh suggest that some students would do the opposite
of helping each other, i.e. sabotage. </p>
<p>A better way of trying to determine if students are cheating would be to find
the similarities of their grades. Maybe check to see how many homework grades are
exactly the same. The more exact same grades out of 50 points, the more likely two
students are assisting each other. </p>

  <li>Second chart maps the number of exact same grades each student receives with
  another. This may be a another supplemental way of understanding how students are
working together. </li>
